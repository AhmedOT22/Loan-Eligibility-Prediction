# Loan Eligibility Prediction App

This is a modular, production-ready Streamlit application that predicts loan approval likelihood based on applicant data. The model uses a cleaned and preprocessed version of the UCI Loan Prediction dataset and is backed by a trained Random Forest classifier.

---

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses raw loan application data
- Trains a Random Forest classifier on cleaned data (or loads a pre-trained model)
- Saves preprocessed data, model, and scaler for reuse
- Displays model accuracy at the top of the interface
- Renders a user-friendly form for applicant input
- Predicts loan approval in real time based on user input
- Visualizes results using a gauge with arrow pointer and color-coded interpretation
- Logs application behavior and handles errors gracefully
